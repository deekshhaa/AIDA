        <h3> <i>Five Fold Activities ~ Panchmukhi Shiksha</i> </h3>
        <p> Banasthali Vidyapith aims at the synthesis of spiritual value of the East and scientific spirit of the West.
            The main thrust of all the activities of the Banasthali Vidyapith is the development of a complete
            personality. The institution firmly believes that the personality consists of interdependent components,
            each being equally important requiring equal attention and can only be developed through a wholesome
            education. The ‘Panchmukhi Shiksha’ which has evolved from experimentation, attempts a balance among the
            five necessary aspects of education: Physical, Practical, Aesthetic, Moral and Intellectual. </p>
