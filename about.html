                <h2> We are World's Second Largest Women's University</h2>
                <p>Banasthali Vidyapith is a fully residential women's higher education institute which offers an 
                    integrated system extending from the primary to the Ph.D. level. It was on October 6, 1935 that
                     Smt. Ratan Shastri and Pandit Hiralal Shastri founded Banasthali to fill up the vacuum caused 
                     by the sudden death of their highly talented and promising daughter Shantabai. They had high 
                     expectations that she would work for women's cause when she would grow up. But destiny
                      ordained otherwise. Thus, Banasthali owes its existence neither to the zeal of an 
                      educationist, nor to that of a social reformer. It is also not the creation of a 
                      Philanthropist's purse. It has arisen like the fabled phoenix from the ashes of a 
                      blossoming flower Shantabai. Banasthali is one of the five higher education institute in
                       India meant exclusively for Women. Over these seventy five years Banasthali has developed 
                       into a National Centre for women's education. Banasthali's educational programme aims at an
                        all-round development of the student's personality. To achieve its objective of 'synthesis 
                        of spiritual values and scientific achievements of the East and the West', it has evolved 
                        Five-fold Educational Programme (Panchmukhi Shiksha) comprising of the following aspects :<br>
                    (i) Physical<br>
                    (ii) Practical<br>
                    (iii) Aesthetic<br>
                    (iv) Moral<br>
                    (v) Intellectual.<br>
                    This way the students develop an integrated and balanced personality.</p>
